<h1>What is S2S?</h1>

<p>S2S is a minimal VAL3 porting of the "S7_micro_client" class of the SNAP7 library (Copyright (C) 2013, Davide Nardella, <a href="http://snap7.sourceforge.net/" title="http://snap7.sourceforge.net/" class="http">http://snap7.sourceforge.net/</a>).
<br>S2S is an acronym for "Staubli to Siemens" (or "Siemens to Staubli" if you prefer!).<br>
<b>It allows the read/write communication from a Staubli Robotic Controller to a Siemens PLC over a standard ethernet TCP/IP connection</b>, without the needs of a specific fieldbus.<br>  
<br>
In this repo you'll find a folder with an SRS cell with the library and some usage demos, and another folder with a full documentation in english.
<br>  
<b>S2S it's not an official Staubli product!</b>
